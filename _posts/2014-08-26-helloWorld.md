##Hello, World!
Hi I’m Ursula, it’s nice to meet you. I’m in my third year at York University studying Computer Science. I specialize in building interactive augmented reality applications in Unity. This website is designed to showcase some of the cool stuff I’m working on, but will also be a place where I can talk about some of the interesting day to day things that I encounter.
