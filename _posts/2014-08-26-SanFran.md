##San Francisco, CA
I have the great opportunity to head down to San Francisco this week to work with Steve Mann on some cool augmented reality applications for Meta’s new holographic interface, SpaceGlasses.

Last week Steve Mann, his team and I, spent a couple days hacking together an application built in Unity in preparation for a demo day going on at Meta’s HQ located in Portola Valley, California. In only 3 (long) days we were able to pull off a fully functioning app running on any Android device which visualizes the veillances emitted by public cameras. Hopefully this week we can develop this small Unity app further, and push it to the SpaceGlasses.

I’m very excited to see where we can take it in the next few weeks!
