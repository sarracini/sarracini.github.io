##Basics of Code Workshop
This week I ran my first workshop - the Basics of Code. I didn’t really know anything about running a workshop, so you can imagine my reaction when 25 first and second year CS students showed up eager to learn something from me. I had prepared 5 small programming questions that I would work through with them, teaching them the logic behind how to break down the problems into smaller, easier, more solvable problems. 

I really enjoyed leading the workshop, it feels good to be able to help other people and inspire them to code. Hopefully I’ll get the opportunity to do more in the future!

If you’re new to Java and you feel daring, you can download the workshop files here. Take a look at them, compile them, and fool around with the code.
