                <h1>Past Epiphanies and Future Goals</h1>
                <p id="date">January 05, 2016</p>
                Looking at it now, I'd say 2015 set the bar pretty high. I didn't travel the world, or get a six pack (I'll try again this year), and unfortunately I didn't get a puppy, but I did get a chance to figure out what the heck it is I want to be doing for the rest of my life. Which, as it turns out, is a pretty awesome feeling. 
                </p><p>
OK, 'rest of your life' is kind of an intimidating timeframe, but I definitely figured out what I really enjoy doing. Surprisingly enough, that thing is <i>writing code</i>. Over the summer I was an intern at Mozilla, hacking on some cool stuff on Firefox's front-end, and I admit it was a scary twelve weeks. No, not because Mozilla is a scary place to work - on the contrary it was such an awesome place to work that I decided to go back and work there full time starting this year - but because I wasn't sure if writing code was something I actually liked doing. So I decided, what better way to find out if I like doing this, than by actually doing it? I sort of used the internship as an experiment for myself. I thought it could go one of two ways:</p>
<p/><p>
                <b>Outcome 1:</b> Oh hell no, this is definitely not what I thought this was going to be and I can't even look at a computer anymore. Programming has ruined me.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
<i>OR</i> </p>
<p>
<b>Outcome 2:</b> Hey writing a bunch of things on a computer and making it do things is actually pretty neat! Give me more!
<br/></p>
                <p>
Luckily for me outcome 2 was the winner. This was important for me to realize because I remember first learning programming in school and absolutely hating it - like, name your variables 'iHateEverything' in every assignment I used to get, hating it. And I also remember how little I actually learned about programming when I had that attitude. I didn't want that to happen again so when I started my internship at Mozilla I went in excited, ambitious, and ready to learn a lot. So what I learned this year was that sometimes you think you really hate something, but actually it's just because you don't understand it yet, and keeping an open mind about it will often sway you in a different direction. After three months of working with awesome people and learning a ton of new things about the interwebz, I ended up really wanting to write more code. 2015 showed me that it's something that I want to continue learning and perfecting in the future.</p>

                    <p>
That being said, 2016 has some pretty awesome stuff in store. For starters, I'm GRADUATING. Take a second and share my excitement here because that means I can start working full time at Mozilla soon! I'll still be hacking away at some Firefox stuff, and that's pretty exciting! I also made a little list of things I want to do in 2016:</p>

<li id="post_list">
<ul><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>
graduate from university</ul>
    <ul><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>
do a handstand</ul>
    <ul><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>
blog more</ul>
    <ul><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>
do 25 push ups in a row</ul>
    <ul><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>
fall out of love with object-oriented programming and into love with functional programming</ul>
                    </li></p><p>
A lot can change in just one year. So bring it on 2016, I'm ready for you.
